# Task ID: 9
# Title: Build Ship Browser UI Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive ship browsing interface with filtering and skill-aware display
# Details:
Create ShipBrowser component with Material-UI DataGrid for ship list. Implement filters: race (Caldari, Gallente, etc.), ship class, tech level, skill requirements met. Add search with fuzzy matching using fuse.js@7.0.0. Display ship cards with: image, name, slot layout, base stats, skill requirements (green if met, red if not). Implement virtualization for performance with react-window@1.8.10. Add sorting by name, class, required skills. Create ship detail modal with full stats. Use React.memo for optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Test filtering logic, verify skill requirement calculations, test performance with 500+ ships, test search functionality
