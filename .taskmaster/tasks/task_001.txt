# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Electron + TypeScript Project Foundation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize a new Electron project with TypeScript configuration, including proper build tooling and development environment setup
# Details:
Use Electron 28.x with TypeScript 5.3+. Setup electron-forge for build management. Configure webpack 5 for optimal bundling. Structure: src/main (main process), src/renderer (React app), src/shared (shared types). Install core dependencies: electron@28.1.0, typescript@5.3.3, @electron-forge/cli@7.2.0. Configure tsconfig.json with strict mode, ES2022 target. Setup nodemon for main process hot reload. Configure CSP headers for security.

# Test Strategy:
Verify electron app launches, TypeScript compiles without errors, hot reload works for both main/renderer processes. Test production build generation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize the Project [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new project directory and initialize it with npm to generate a package.json file.
### Details:
Run 'npm init' in your project directory to set up the initial package.json. This step lays the foundation for dependency management and project configuration.[1][2]

## 2. Configure TypeScript [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Install TypeScript and set up the TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) with appropriate compiler options.
### Details:
Install TypeScript as a dev dependency. Generate tsconfig.json using 'tsc --init' and configure options such as 'outDir', 'target', 'module', 'strict', and 'esModuleInterop'.[1][4]

## 3. Set Up Electron Forge [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Install Electron Forge and configure it to work with TypeScript.
### Details:
Install Electron Forge and its CLI. Configure Electron Forge to use TypeScript by installing 'ts-node' and creating a 'forge.config.ts' file for project configuration.[5]

## 4. Configure Webpack [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Install and configure Webpack for bundling TypeScript and Electron code.
### Details:
Install Webpack and necessary loaders/plugins for TypeScript. Set up Webpack configuration files to handle both main and renderer processes, ensuring compatibility with Electron and TypeScript.

## 5. Structure Source Directories [done]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Organize the project directory structure for Electron's main and renderer processes.
### Details:
Create directories such as 'src/main' and 'src/renderer' for clear separation of Electron's main and renderer code. Add entry files like 'main.ts' and 'index.html'.[2]

## 6. Install and Configure Dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 1.5
### Description: Install Electron, TypeScript types, and any additional dependencies required for development.
### Details:
Install Electron, @types/electron, and any other libraries needed for your app. Update package.json scripts for building and running the app.[1][4]

## 7. Set Up Development Tools and CSP Headers [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure development tools like nodemon for hot reloading and set up Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
### Details:
Install nodemon or similar tools for automatic reloads during development. Configure CSP headers in your Electron app to enhance security.
