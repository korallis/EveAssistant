# Status: done
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Build genetic algorithm for generating optimized fittings across DPS-Tank spectrum
# Details:
Implement NSGA-II algorithm for multi-objective optimization. Create FittingOptimizer class with fitness functions for DPS, EHP, cap stability. Generate initial population using heuristics (weapon systems, tank type). Implement crossover operations respecting slot constraints. Add mutation operators (swap modules, change charges). Use Pareto frontier selection. Configure parameters: population size 100, generations 50, mutation rate 0.1. Implement early stopping on convergence. Add constraints for CPU/PG, skill requirements. Create 5 representative fittings from Pareto frontier.

# Test Strategy:

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement NSGA-II Core Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the main NSGA-II algorithm framework with the basic genetic algorithm structure and modified selection mechanisms
### Details:
Implement the core NSGA-II structure following the general outline of genetic algorithms with modified mating and survival selection. Include the non-dominated sorting approach with O(MNÂ²) computational complexity where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size. Create the main loop structure that combines parent and offspring populations.

## 2. Create Multi-Objective Fitness Functions [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop fitness functions that can evaluate solutions across multiple objectives
### Details:
Design and implement fitness functions that can handle multiple competing objectives. These functions should be able to evaluate solutions based on different criteria and return a vector of fitness values rather than a single scalar value. Test with benchmark problems like ZDT1 or ZDT5.

## 3. Generate Initial Population [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Implement methods to create a diverse initial population of candidate solutions
### Details:
Create sampling methods for generating the initial population with appropriate diversity. Implement different sampling strategies like BinaryRandomSampling for binary decision variables or other sampling methods depending on the problem domain. Ensure the population size is configurable.

## 4. Implement Crossover Operators [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.3
### Description: Develop crossover mechanisms for creating offspring from parent solutions
### Details:
Implement various crossover operators such as TwoPointCrossover for binary problems or other appropriate crossover methods for different problem types. Ensure the crossover probability is configurable and the operators maintain solution validity.

## 5. Add Mutation Operators [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.3
### Description: Create mutation functions to introduce diversity in the population
### Details:
Implement mutation operators like BitflipMutation for binary problems or other appropriate mutation methods. Ensure mutation rates are configurable and the operators maintain solution validity while introducing sufficient diversity to avoid premature convergence.

## 6. Handle Constraints [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Develop mechanisms to handle constrained optimization problems
### Details:
Modify the dominance definition to efficiently solve constrained multi-objective problems. Implement constraint handling techniques that can work with problems having multiple constraints (e.g., the referenced five-objective seven-constraint nonlinear problem).

## 7. Implement Pareto Selection [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Create the non-dominated sorting and crowding distance calculation for Pareto-based selection
### Details:
Implement the fast non-dominated sorting approach to rank solutions into different non-dominated fronts. Add crowding distance calculation to maintain diversity along the Pareto front. Create the crowded-comparison operator for tournament selection and final population selection.

## 8. Configure Algorithm Parameters [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7
### Description: Create a parameter configuration system for the NSGA-II algorithm
### Details:
Develop a configuration system that allows setting all relevant parameters: population size, number of generations, crossover and mutation probabilities, selection pressure, and other algorithm-specific parameters. Include options for eliminating duplicates.

## 9. Add Early Stopping Criteria [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.7
### Description: Implement various termination conditions beyond maximum iterations
### Details:
Add multiple stopping criteria beyond the typical maximum number of iterations, such as convergence measures, diversity thresholds, or computational budget limits. Implement a flexible framework that allows combining different stopping criteria.

## 10. Generate Representative Fittings [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.7, 12.8
### Description: Create visualization and analysis tools for the Pareto-optimal solutions
### Details:
Implement visualization tools like Scatter plots to display the Pareto front. Add functionality to compare the obtained front with the true Pareto front when available. Create methods to analyze the spread and convergence of solutions and to help decision-makers select final solutions from the Pareto set.
