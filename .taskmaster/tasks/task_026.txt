# Task ID: 26
# Title: Design Database Schema - refined
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Define the structure and relationships of database tables.
# Details:
Create an ER diagram and document table definitions, primary/foreign keys, and relationships.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Database Requirements [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and document all data elements, relationships, and business rules needed for the database schema.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive data dictionary listing all data elements to be stored. Document business rules that affect data integrity and relationships. Identify primary entities and their attributes.

## 2. Create Entity-Relationship Diagram [done]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Design a visual representation of database entities and their relationships.
### Details:
Use appropriate notation to represent entities, attributes, and relationships. Clearly indicate cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many). Include all entities identified in the requirements analysis.

## 3. Define Table Structures [done]
### Dependencies: 26.2
### Description: Specify detailed table definitions including columns, data types, and constraints.
### Details:
For each entity in the ER diagram, create corresponding table definitions. Document column names, data types, and constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, etc.). Establish naming conventions for consistency.

## 4. Implement Keys and Relationships [done]
### Dependencies: 26.3
### Description: Define primary keys, foreign keys, and implement table relationships.
### Details:
Identify and document primary keys for each table. Define foreign keys to implement relationships between tables. Consider indexing strategies for performance optimization. Document referential integrity constraints.

## 5. Normalize and Optimize Schema [done]
### Dependencies: 26.4
### Description: Apply normalization techniques and optimize the schema for performance and data integrity.
### Details:
Apply appropriate normalization forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to eliminate redundancy. Consider denormalization where necessary for performance. Document any performance optimizations or trade-offs made in the design.
