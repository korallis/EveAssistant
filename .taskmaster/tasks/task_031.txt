# Task ID: 31
# Title: Implement DPS Calculation - refined
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the logic to calculate damage per second (DPS) for all weapon and module types, accounting for rate of fire, damage modifiers, and relevant bonuses.
# Details:
This includes handling different weapon types, ammo effects, and integrating with skill and module bonuses.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Base DPS Formula Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core DPS calculation function that multiplies damage per hit by hits per second
### Details:
Implement the fundamental DPS = Damage * HitsPerSecond formula as a reusable function that will serve as the foundation for all weapon types. Include proper documentation and unit tests to verify basic functionality.

## 2. Implement Weapon Type-Specific DPS Calculations [done]
### Dependencies: 31.1
### Description: Extend the base DPS calculation to handle different weapon types with unique firing mechanics
### Details:
Create specialized calculation methods for each weapon type (e.g., single-shot, burst fire, continuous beam) that account for their unique rate of fire characteristics, reload times, and damage profiles.

## 3. Implement Ammunition and Damage Modifier Effects [done]
### Dependencies: 31.2
### Description: Add support for ammunition types and damage modifiers that affect the final DPS calculation
### Details:
Create a system to apply various ammunition effects (elemental damage, armor penetration, etc.) and damage modifiers to the base DPS calculation. This should include percentage-based and flat damage adjustments.

## 4. Integrate Skill and Module Bonus Systems [done]
### Dependencies: 31.3
### Description: Connect the DPS calculation with character skills and module bonuses that affect damage output
### Details:
Develop an interface to incorporate skill-based and module-based bonuses into the DPS calculation. This should handle both offensive bonuses (increased damage, critical hit chance) and defensive considerations (target armor, resistances).

## 5. Create DPS Comparison and Optimization Tools [done]
### Dependencies: 31.4
### Description: Develop utilities to compare DPS across different weapon configurations and suggest optimizations
### Details:
Build tools that allow for easy comparison of DPS across different weapon, ammunition, and module combinations. Include visualization components and optimization suggestions to help users maximize their damage output.
