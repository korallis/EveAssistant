# Task ID: 32
# Title: Implement Drag-and-Drop Functionality - refined
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Add the ability to drag and drop modules within the editor interface
# Details:
Implement the Inplace Editor pattern to allow users to manipulate modules directly in the interface. Include visual feedback during drag operations, valid drop zones highlighting, and proper event handling for module placement and rearrangement.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Draggable Modules and Drop Zones [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify which modules within the editor interface should be draggable and specify valid drop zones for module placement.
### Details:
Review the editor's module structure and mark elements with the 'draggable' attribute. Clearly define and visually distinguish valid drop zones for module rearrangement.

## 2. Implement Drag Event Handlers [done]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Add event handlers for drag operations, including dragstart, dragover, dragenter, dragleave, and drop events.
### Details:
Attach appropriate event listeners to draggable modules and drop zones. Use the dataTransfer API to manage drag data and ensure correct module identification during drag-and-drop.

## 3. Provide Visual Feedback During Drag Operations [done]
### Dependencies: 32.2
### Description: Implement visual cues such as highlighting dragged modules and valid drop zones to enhance user experience.
### Details:
Update module and drop zone styles dynamically during drag events to indicate active dragging and valid drop targets.

## 4. Handle Module Placement and Rearrangement [done]
### Dependencies: 32.3
### Description: Update the editor's state to reflect module placement and rearrangement upon successful drop actions.
### Details:
Modify the underlying data structure to move modules based on user drag-and-drop actions, ensuring the UI updates accordingly.

## 5. Test and Refine Drag-and-Drop Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 32.4
### Description: Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure robust drag-and-drop behavior, accessibility, and edge case handling.
### Details:
Perform manual and automated tests for various scenarios, including invalid drops, rapid interactions, and keyboard accessibility. Refine implementation based on test results.
