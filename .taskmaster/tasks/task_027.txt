# Task ID: 27
# Title: Create Data Transformers - refined
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement data transformation logic to convert parsed YAML data into the application's required formats.
# Details:
Transformers should support mapping, filtering, and restructuring of data as needed for downstream use.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Transformer Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core architecture for data transformers that will handle YAML data conversion
### Details:
Develop a flexible transformer architecture that supports mapping, filtering, and restructuring operations. Include interfaces/abstract classes that define the transformation contract and establish a pipeline for sequential transformations.

## 2. Implement Mapping Transformers [done]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Build transformers that map fields from source YAML to target application formats
### Details:
Create mapping transformers that can rename fields, transform data types, and handle nested structures. Implement both simple 1:1 field mapping and complex transformations that combine multiple source fields into target fields.

## 3. Develop Filtering Transformers [done]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Create transformers that can filter YAML data based on specified conditions
### Details:
Implement filtering logic that can include/exclude data based on field values, existence checks, or custom predicates. Support both simple boolean conditions and complex logical expressions combining multiple conditions.

## 4. Build Restructuring Transformers [done]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Implement transformers that can reshape the structure of YAML data
### Details:
Create transformers capable of restructuring data hierarchies, flattening nested structures, grouping related data, and transforming arrays/lists. Support operations like splitting, merging, and reordering of data elements.

## 5. Create Transformer Configuration System [done]
### Dependencies: 27.2, 27.3, 27.4
### Description: Develop a configuration mechanism to define and customize transformer behavior
### Details:
Implement a declarative configuration system that allows defining transformation rules without code changes. Support configuration via YAML/JSON files that specify mapping rules, filter conditions, and restructuring operations. Include validation for configuration correctness.
