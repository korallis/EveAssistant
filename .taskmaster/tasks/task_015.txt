# Task ID: 15
# Title: Create Character Skills Management Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build comprehensive skill viewer and planner interface
# Details:
Create SkillsView component displaying character skills in categories. Show skill levels with progress bars. Implement skill search and filtering. Display total SP and unallocated SP. Create skill queue viewer showing training plan. Add 'Skills for Fitting' analyzer showing missing skills. Implement skill plan optimizer suggesting shortest path to fly a ship/fitting. Use Material-UI TreeView for skill categories. Add skill tooltips with descriptions and bonuses. Create visual skill requirement trees. Cache skill data with 1-hour TTL.

# Test Strategy:
Test skill calculations, verify queue time estimates, test skill requirement analysis, check data synchronization with ESI

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Skills View Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the main skills view component that will serve as the container for all skill-related information and interactions.
### Details:
Build a reusable component that displays skills in an organized layout. Implement proper visual hierarchy to highlight important skill information. Follow component architecture best practices by keeping the component focused on a single task and ensuring it can accept props for dynamic data display.

## 2. Implement Search and Filtering Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create search and filtering components that allow users to quickly find specific skills or filter skills based on various criteria.
### Details:
Design input fields for search functionality with real-time results. Implement dropdown menus or checkboxes for filtering options. Ensure the components are responsive and provide clear visual feedback during user interaction. Consider implementing debounce for search to optimize performance.

## 3. Display SP and Queue Information [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create components to display Skill Points (SP) and queue information in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.
### Details:
Design progress bars or numerical indicators for SP display. Implement a queue visualization that shows pending skill acquisitions. Ensure these components update dynamically when changes occur. Use appropriate color theory to indicate different states or priorities in the queue.

## 4. Build Skill Analyzer Component [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.3
### Description: Develop a component that analyzes skills and provides useful insights or recommendations to the user.
### Details:
Create an analyzer that processes skill data and generates meaningful metrics. Implement data visualization elements like charts or graphs to represent analysis results. Ensure the component can handle complex calculations while maintaining good performance. Design clear visual outputs that help users understand the analysis.

## 5. Implement Skill Optimizer [done]
### Dependencies: 15.4
### Description: Create a component that helps users optimize their skill selections based on various factors and goals.
### Details:
Design an interface that allows users to set optimization goals. Implement algorithms that calculate optimal skill paths based on user inputs. Create visual representations of optimization results using appropriate UI elements like tables or highlighted paths. Ensure the optimizer provides clear explanations of its recommendations.

## 6. Add Tooltips for Skill Information [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Implement tooltips that provide additional information about skills when users hover over or interact with skill elements.
### Details:
Design tooltips that display relevant skill details without cluttering the interface. Implement hover or click interactions to trigger tooltips. Ensure tooltips are positioned correctly and don't obscure important content. Include helpful information in tooltips such as skill requirements, benefits, and relationships to other skills.

## 7. Create Skill Trees Visualization [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.6
### Description: Develop a component that visualizes skill relationships and dependencies in a tree or graph structure.
### Details:
Design an interactive skill tree that clearly shows relationships between skills. Implement navigation controls for large skill trees. Ensure the visualization is responsive and works across different screen sizes. Add visual indicators for acquired skills, available skills, and locked skills within the tree structure.

## 8. Implement Skill Data Caching [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, 15.7
### Description: Create a caching mechanism to improve performance when loading and displaying skill data.
### Details:
Implement client-side caching of skill data to reduce server requests. Design a cache invalidation strategy to ensure data freshness. Create loading states for when cache is being populated. Optimize the caching mechanism to prioritize frequently accessed skill information for better user experience.
