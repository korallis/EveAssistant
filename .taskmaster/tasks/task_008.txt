# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement State Management with Zustand
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Setup global state management using Zustand for application-wide state
# Details:
Install zustand@4.5.0. Create stores: useAuthStore (user, tokens, login/logout), useShipStore (ships, filters, selectedShip), useFittingStore (fittings, activeFitting, modifications), useSkillStore (characterSkills, skillQueue). Implement persistence for user preferences using zustand/middleware persist with electron-store. Create computed values using zustand subscriptions. Implement store devtools for debugging. Add TypeScript types for all store slices. Create store hooks with proper memoization.

# Test Strategy:
Test state updates, verify persistence works, test computed values update correctly, verify no unnecessary re-renders

# Subtasks:

## 2. Create individual store slices [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement separate store slices for auth, ships, fittings, and skills domains
### Details:
Create separate files for each domain slice (authSlice.js, shipsSlice.js, fittingsSlice.js, skillsSlice.js). Define state structure and actions for each slice. Use proper typing if TypeScript is used. Implement proper state update patterns using the set function.
<info added on 2025-06-06T09:14:19.485Z>
Successfully implemented all required store slices with comprehensive functionality:

authStore.ts implementation includes user profile management storing character name, corporation, and avatar data. Authentication token handling with secure storage and automatic refresh capabilities. Login and logout functions with proper state cleanup.

shipStore.ts provides complete ship data management including listing with advanced filtering options, ship selection tracking, and full CRUD operations for ship management. Implemented detailed TypeScript interfaces for ship properties, attributes, and requirements.

fittingStore.ts delivers robust fitting management with module handling for high/mid/low slots and rigs. CRUD operations for creating, updating, and deleting fittings. Module operations support adding, removing, and toggling module states. Import/export functionality supports common fitting formats.

skillStore.ts enables comprehensive skill tracking with skill data storage and filtering by groups and categories. Skill queue management with add/remove/reorder operations. Training time calculations considering character attributes and implants. TypeScript definitions for skill levels, requirements, and queue items.

All stores utilize Zustand's devtools middleware for enhanced debugging experience. Consistent action naming conventions across all stores improve devtool readability. Each store follows established patterns with proper TypeScript typing ensuring type safety throughout the application.

## 3. Implement persistence with electron-store [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Add persistence layer to store state between application sessions
### Details:
Install electron-store package. Create a persistence middleware for Zustand. Configure which parts of the state should be persisted. Implement loading of persisted state on application startup. Add migration strategies for handling state structure changes.
<info added on 2025-06-06T09:21:40.870Z>
Successfully completed the persistence implementation with electron-store. Created a robust persistence middleware in src/renderer/store/middleware/persist.ts that includes an electronStorage adapter for Zustand's persist middleware and a createPersistentStore utility function for streamlined store creation. Added migration helpers to handle store version changes gracefully.

Implemented two persistent stores as proof of concept:
- configStore: Manages application-wide settings including theme and UI preferences
- preferencesStore: Handles user preferences for different application views (ships, fittings, skills)

Both stores feature proper versioning and migration strategies to ensure data integrity across application updates. Used the partialize function to selectively persist only necessary state properties, optimizing storage efficiency. All implementations include comprehensive TypeScript types for stores and middleware, ensuring type safety throughout the persistence layer.

The persistence infrastructure is now production-ready and can be easily extended to any store requiring data persistence between application sessions.

## 4. Add computed values with subscriptions [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Implement derived state values using Zustand subscriptions
### Details:
Create computed properties that derive from the base state. Implement subscription mechanism to update computed values when dependencies change. Optimize subscriptions to prevent unnecessary recalculations. Document the subscription patterns for team reference.
<info added on 2025-06-06T09:26:16.218Z>
Completed implementing computed values with subscriptions:

1. Created a comprehensive computed values utility in src/renderer/store/utils/computed.ts:
   - Implemented `computed` function to create computed hooks from store selectors
   - Added `createComputed` for simplified computed value creation
   - Created `createSubscription` for reactive store subscriptions
   - Added `createSelector` for memoized selectors

2. Created two stores that utilize computed values:
   - statsStore: Aggregates statistics from multiple stores (ships, fittings, skills)
   - fittingAnalysisStore: Performs complex calculations on ship fittings

3. Implemented automatic subscriptions that update derived values when source data changes
4. Created specialized computed selectors for component use:
   - useActiveShipPercentage, useSkillCompletionPercentage, useDominantRace
   - useSelectedAnalysis, useResourceUtilization, useDamageTypeBreakdown

5. Ensured all computed values are properly typed with TypeScript

The computed values system provides efficient, reactive derived state that updates automatically when source data changes, preventing unnecessary re-renders and calculations.

   - Created `createStoreHook` to combine state and actions into a single hook
   - Added `createActionHook` and `createActionsHook` for memoized action dispatching

2. Implemented specialized, memoized hooks for each primary store:
   - **`useShipHooks.ts`**: Created hooks like `useShips`, `useActiveShip`, `useFilteredShips`, `useShipById`, and action hooks like `useShipActions` and `useSetActiveShip`. Added derived data hooks like `useShipRaces` and `useShipGroups`
   - **`useFittingHooks.ts`**: Implemented `useFittings`, `useActiveFitting`, `useFilteredFittings`, and derived hooks like `useFittingById`, `useFittingsByShipType`, and `useActiveFittingWithShip`
   - **`useSkillHooks.ts`**: Added `useSkills`, `useSkillQueue`, `useFilteredSkills`, and derived/statistical hooks like `useSkillById`, `useSkillsInTraining`, and `useSkillTrainingStats`

3. Organized all hooks into a central `src/renderer/store/hooks/index.ts` for easy importing

4. Updated the main store entry point (`src/renderer/store/index.ts`) to export all selector utilities and the new hooks module

This structure provides an efficient, organized, and scalable way for components to interact with the stores, ensuring optimal performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.
