# Task ID: 34
# Title: Implement Magic 14 Default Skill Plan
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 15, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a default skill plan system that displays the 'Magic 14' fundamental skills when no ship or fitting is selected for optimization, providing new players with a proven starting point for character development.
# Details:
Create Magic14SkillPlan component that defines the 14 core skills: CPU Management V, Power Grid Management V, Capacitor Management V, Capacitor Systems Operation V, Mechanics V, Hull Upgrades V, Shield Management V, Shield Operation V, Navigation V, Evasive Maneuvering V, Warp Drive Operation V, Spaceship Command V, Drones V, and Weapon Upgrades V. Implement detection logic in SkillPlanOptimizer to check if selectedShip or activeFitting exists in stores. When neither is selected, display Magic14View with skill cards showing: skill name, current level vs recommended level V, training time remaining, total SP required, and skill description from ESI. Create progress visualization showing overall Magic 14 completion percentage. Add 'Why Magic 14?' info panel explaining benefits: fitting flexibility, capacitor stability, navigation improvements, and tank bonuses. Implement skill prioritization algorithm suggesting training order based on current levels and time efficiency. Add export functionality to create EVE skill plan format. Include tooltips showing which ship attributes each skill improves. Create comparison view showing character's current stats vs stats with Magic 14 completed. Store Magic 14 progress in useSkillStore for quick access. Add notification when character completes Magic 14. Implement skill book cost calculator showing total ISK investment needed.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Magic 14 displays when no ship/fitting is selected by clearing selections and checking UI. Confirm all 14 skills are correctly identified with proper typeIDs. Test skill level detection matches character's actual skills from ESI. Validate training time calculations account for current skill levels and attributes. Check progress percentage accurately reflects completion status (0-100%). Test export function generates valid EVE skill plan format. Verify tooltips display correct attribute improvements for each skill. Test prioritization algorithm suggests logical training order. Confirm cost calculator shows accurate ISK values from market data. Validate info panel clearly explains Magic 14 benefits. Test responsive layout on different screen sizes. Verify state persistence of Magic 14 progress across app restarts. Check performance with large skill queues. Test edge cases: character with all Magic 14 at V, character with no skills trained, alpha clone restrictions.
