# Task ID: 21
# Title: Build Intelligent Caching System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement sophisticated multi-layer caching for optimal performance
# Details:
Create CacheManager with memory (LRU) and disk (SQLite) layers. Implement cache key generation with versioning. Add TTL management based on data type (SDE: permanent, skills: 1 hour, market: 5 min). Create cache warming on app start for common data. Implement cache invalidation strategies. Add offline mode detection with graceful degradation. Create cache size management with eviction policies. Implement differential updates for large datasets. Add cache statistics monitoring. Use IPC for cache synchronization between processes.

# Test Strategy:
Test cache hit/miss rates, verify TTL expiration, test offline functionality, measure performance improvements, test cache size limits

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement CacheManager [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core CacheManager component responsible for orchestrating cache operations, including storing, retrieving, and managing cached data.
### Details:
Define interfaces and core logic for cache access, ensuring extensibility for future layers and features.

## 2. Integrate Memory and Disk Cache Layers [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Add support for both in-memory and disk-based cache layers to enable multi-tiered caching.
### Details:
Implement logic for reading from and writing to both memory and disk, with fallback mechanisms and synchronization between layers.

## 3. Implement Time-To-Live (TTL) Management [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2
### Description: Add TTL support to automatically expire cache entries after a specified duration.
### Details:
Ensure each cache entry can be assigned a TTL and that expired entries are purged or refreshed as needed.

## 4. Develop Cache Warming Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2, 21.3
### Description: Create a system to pre-populate the cache with frequently accessed or critical data at startup or on demand.
### Details:
Design strategies for identifying and loading hot data to minimize cold start latency.

## 5. Implement Cache Invalidation Strategies [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2, 21.3
### Description: Develop mechanisms to invalidate or update cache entries when underlying data changes.
### Details:
Support manual, event-driven, and TTL-based invalidation to ensure cache consistency.

## 6. Add Offline Detection and Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2, 21.3
### Description: Enable the cache system to detect offline scenarios and adjust cache behavior accordingly.
### Details:
Implement logic to serve stale data or queue updates when the system is offline, resynchronizing when connectivity is restored.

## 7. Implement Cache Size Management and Eviction Policies [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2, 21.3
### Description: Add mechanisms to monitor and control cache size, including eviction policies like LRU or LFU.
### Details:
Ensure optimal resource usage by automatically removing least valuable entries when limits are reached.

## 8. Enable Differential Cache Updates [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2, 21.3, 21.5
### Description: Implement support for updating only changed portions of cached data rather than full replacements.
### Details:
Optimize network and storage usage by applying diffs or patches to cached entries.

## 9. Add Cache Statistics and Monitoring [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2, 21.3, 21.4, 21.5, 21.6, 21.7, 21.8
### Description: Integrate monitoring tools to track cache performance, hit/miss rates, and resource usage.
### Details:
Expose metrics for observability and tuning, supporting alerts and dashboards as needed.
