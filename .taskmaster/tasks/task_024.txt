# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Auto-Update System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: low
# Description: Build secure auto-update mechanism for distributing new versions
# Details:
Implement electron-updater@6.1.7 with code signing certificates. Setup update server (GitHub Releases or custom). Create update UI with progress indication. Implement differential updates to minimize download size. Add update channels (stable, beta). Create rollback mechanism for failed updates. Implement update notifications with changelog display. Add manual update check option. Configure auto-update settings (frequency, background downloads). Sign updates for Windows/Mac. Create update testing framework.

# Test Strategy:
Test update flow on all platforms, verify signature validation, test rollback scenarios, test differential updates, verify security

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Updater Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core updater component that can check for, download, and apply updates
### Details:
Create a robust updater module that can scan the environment, identify outdated components, and handle the update process. Implement reliability mechanisms to ensure updates complete successfully even with interruptions. Include integrity verification to confirm updates are complete and valid before applying.

## 2. Set Up Secure Update Server [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish a secure server infrastructure to host and distribute update files
### Details:
Configure a server environment with proper authentication, encryption, and access controls. Implement mechanisms to store different versions of updates, manage update metadata, and track update distribution statistics. Ensure the server can handle the expected load and has redundancy measures.

## 3. Create User-Friendly Update Interface [done]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Design and implement a user interface for update notifications and controls
### Details:
Develop an intuitive UI that notifies users about available updates, displays update details, shows progress during installation, and provides options to schedule, postpone, or skip updates. Ensure the interface is accessible and provides clear information about update benefits.

## 4. Implement Differential Update System [done]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.2
### Description: Create a system that only downloads and applies changes between versions
### Details:
Design and implement a differential update mechanism that identifies only the changed components between versions, reducing bandwidth usage and update time. Include verification systems to ensure differential updates are applied correctly and completely.

## 5. Add Multiple Update Channels [done]
### Dependencies: 24.2
### Description: Implement different update channels (stable, beta, nightly) for various user segments
### Details:
Create a channel-based distribution system allowing users to opt into different update streams based on their preference for stability versus new features. Include channel switching capabilities and proper versioning to manage transitions between channels.

## 6. Create Rollback Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.4
### Description: Develop functionality to revert to previous versions if updates cause issues
### Details:
Implement a system to backup critical components before updates, track update history, and provide mechanisms to restore previous versions if problems are detected. Include automated health checks post-update to trigger rollbacks when necessary.

## 7. Implement Notification System [done]
### Dependencies: 24.3
### Description: Create a comprehensive notification system for update events and statuses
### Details:
Develop a notification framework that alerts users about available updates, scheduled maintenance windows, update progress, completion status, and any issues encountered. Include customization options for notification frequency and types.

## 8. Configure Code Signing and Security Verification [done]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.2
### Description: Implement code signing and verification to ensure update authenticity
### Details:
Set up a code signing infrastructure to digitally sign all updates. Implement verification mechanisms in the updater to confirm signature validity before applying updates. Include certificate management processes and revocation handling for compromised certificates.
