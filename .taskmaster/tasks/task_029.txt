# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement Auth Token Injection - refined
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Add authentication mechanism to inject tokens into API requests
# Details:
Implement token acquisition, storage, refresh logic, and automatic injection into request headers. Ensure the solution handles token expiration gracefully and supports different authentication flows as required by ESI.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Token Acquisition Flow [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a mechanism to obtain authentication tokens from the server
### Details:
Develop a service that handles user credential submission, server validation, and token generation. Implement the initial authentication flow that exchanges user credentials for an access token. Support different authentication flows as required by ESI.

## 2. Implement Secure Token Storage [done]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Create a secure storage mechanism for authentication tokens
### Details:
Implement secure storage for tokens using HTTP-only cookies, secure local storage, or device-specific secure storage depending on the application requirements. Ensure tokens are encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.

## 3. Develop Token Refresh Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 29.1, 29.2
### Description: Implement mechanism to refresh tokens before they expire
### Details:
Create a service that monitors token expiration and proactively refreshes tokens before they expire. Implement logic to handle refresh token usage and fallback to re-authentication if refresh fails.

## 4. Create Request Header Injection Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 29.2
### Description: Develop system to automatically inject authentication tokens into API request headers
### Details:
Implement an interceptor or middleware that automatically adds the authentication token to the Authorization header of outgoing API requests. Ensure the token is properly formatted (e.g., 'Bearer {token}') according to API requirements.

## 5. Implement Token Validation and Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 29.3, 29.4
### Description: Create robust error handling for authentication failures and token validation
### Details:
Develop logic to handle API responses indicating authentication failures (e.g., 401 errors). Implement token validation on the client side to prevent sending expired tokens. Create user-friendly error messages and recovery flows for authentication issues.
