# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Performance Monitoring and Analytics
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: low
# Description: Add application performance monitoring and usage analytics
# Details:
Implement performance monitoring using Electron's performance API. Track app metrics: startup time, memory usage, calculation speeds. Add anonymous usage analytics with opt-in (using Plausible or similar privacy-focused solution). Monitor API response times and cache hit rates. Create performance dashboard in dev mode. Implement error tracking with Sentry (sanitize sensitive data). Add A/B testing framework for UI experiments. Create user feedback system. Log optimization algorithm performance. Generate performance reports.

# Test Strategy:
Verify metrics accuracy, test privacy compliance, ensure no PII in analytics, test error reporting, benchmark baseline performance
